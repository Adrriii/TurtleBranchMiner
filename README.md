## TurtleBranchMiner

Works best with **Chunky Advanced Mining Turtle**

For now, parameters tweaking is done in the file. Refer to the variable comments for more information.

## How to use

- Put the turtle on a chest, facing the first tunnel it will dig.
- Feed it fuel (required) and torches (optional)
- Set the parameters inside the file to your preferences
- Run the program

Note: If the turtle stops and is stuck on looking for fuel, just put some in it.
